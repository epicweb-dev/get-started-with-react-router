# Nested Routes

TODO: make sure to mention the fact that this isn't just an organizational
thing, it actually affects the mounting of the routes. With nested routing,
when child routes change, the parent does not need to get unmounted.

Can use an example of an input field in the parent route and show that before,
the input field loses it's text content when navigating and after it keeps the
text content.
